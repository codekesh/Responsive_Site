                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.

                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. The new National Education
                Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) introduced by the central government is expected to bring profound changes to
                education in India.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
                prabhu. The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and Shishya was
                very important part of the education. Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded
                centre of higher learning in India from possibly 8th century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could
                be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official
                membership of particular colleges.

                There did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls
                and residential quarters in a Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.
